# arch-bash-scripts

My personal bash scripts for usage on my daily driver laptop.

Scripts which are in the "systemd" directory interact with systemd. Others do various functions that I find useful.

These are customized and for my personal use, and I have them here to help me sync them across installs; your mileage will vary.
